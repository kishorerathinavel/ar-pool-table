    Current commit detects cue balls, arranges the keypoints in a sorted manner (so that thekeypoints dont shift from frame to frame between the balls), draws a gray sphere over the cue balls. In the commented sections of the code, getting the RGB values of the balls was attempted. The final prototype will be displaying overlaid information in mono mode and it would be preferable to show only the white cue ball and other cue balls to be hit - all in white color.
