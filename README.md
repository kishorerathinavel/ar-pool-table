# AR pool table

This repository contains code to implment an augmented reality pool table. This AR system was implemented in 2014. Hence, it predates modern AR displays such as HoloLens, MagicLeap, etc., and involved integrating several off-the-shelf and independent systems such as an AR headset (Lumus DK-32), a tracking system (Optitrack), an RGBD camera rigidly attached to the headset. The experience was that a user could wear the headset, and get visual hints (that were spatially registered) of how to try the next shot.
